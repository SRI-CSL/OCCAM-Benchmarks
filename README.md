# Benchmark runner for OCCAM #

To run OCCAM on a set of benchmarks and show metrics, type:

	runbench.py 
	runbench.py --rop
	runbench.py --cpu=60 --mem=4096
	
By default, `runbench.py` runs OCCAM on the benchmarks and displays
the number of functions, number of instructions, etc. before and after
the specialization takes place.

The option `--rop` shows also the number of ROP, JOP, and SYS gadgets,
before and after specialization.

The options `--cpu` and `--mem` set limits on CPU (in seconds) and
memory (in MB) for running OCCAM. The compilation of the programs is
unconstrained.

`runbench.py` reads from the `*.set` files to select which benchmarks
to run.  Each `*.set` file is in JSON format. For each benchmark,
there are at three fields: `dirname`, a relative path wrt environment
`OCCAM_HOME` variable, `execname`, the name of the executable, and
`enabled` whether the benchmark is enabled or not. That directory must
contain `Makefile` and `build.sh`. The makefile generates the bitcode
for the benchmark, and `build.sh` runs OCCAM on it. The assumption is
that after running `build.sh` two executables are generated: one with
suffix `_orig` and the other with suffix `_slashed`. The executables
are used by option `--rop` so it is important to follow this
convention.

For instance, the output of `runbench.py` might look like this:

```

`Red` means reduction. If the percentage is negative then it means
that there was an increase.
